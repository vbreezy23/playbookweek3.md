Definitions & Examples
Logic Bomb:

A hidden piece of code set to trigger an attack at a specific time or action.

Example: UBS PaineWebber – an employee planted a logic bomb that damaged thousands of servers.

Notes-to-Self
I was confused about what triggers a logic bomb versus normal malware. Need to review “conditional execution” in NetAcad.
Sometimes logic bombs look like regular code changes—check code reviews!
Need to ask about best ways to quickly remove access for fired employees.
