Raw Configs and Show Outputs Raw configs are the direct configuration commands entered on networking devices (like routers or switches) using the CLI
(Command Line Interface). These are essential for setting up device interfaces, routing protocols, security settings, VLANs, and more.
Errors, Fixes, and Cable Map Errors are common during network configuration. For example, a mis-typed IP address on an interface can result in connectivity failures.
If a show interface command reports "administratively down," this usually means the interface was not enabled with the no shutdown command. The fix would be returning
to interface config mode and entering no shutdown. Another common error is mismatched subnet masks, which can be identified when devices cannot communicate even if 
cabled correctly. Checking show running-config and ensuring all connected devices use compatible masks and IP ranges will resolve this.
A clear cable map helps track connections and quickly troubleshoot if a link goes down or is incorrectly patched.
